                    <p><i>Lost in the Myths of Time</i> is a Stanford University summer seminar sponsored by the
                        Bing Overseas Programs during which we learned about landscapes of defense, identity, and culture of the medieval Mercian kingdom while exploring the kingdom itself. But, this seminar has provided more than a glimpse back in time. Through learning about medieval culture, traditions, and assumptions, we are able to question our own culture, traditions, and assumptions about the world around us. Discussions have explored literary questions about how manuscripts and records were made, who made them and why, and who had access to these written records. We have also explored cultural topics of power dynamics, liminality, and assimilation, all of which are relevant to our world today. Throughout this experience, we have had our opinions challenged, our perspectives appreciated, and our stomachs expanded. This website attempts to capture our experience of the landscapes, while also documenting our responses to all that we have learned from each other and the trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our trip began at Nottingham University, where we were introduced to the medieval Mercian landscape through boundary clause analysis, ordnance survey maps and GIS mapping, field trips to nearby medieval sites, and various readings ranging from <i>Beowulf</i> to scholarly works on place-names. In fact, our main focus while in Nottingham was place-names and place-name analysis, providing us with a foundational knowledge of how the landscape would have looked in the medieval era, as well as providing us with purpose and context as we continued on our journey through space and time. Next, we found ourselves in Montgomery, Wales, just a few miles over the English-Welsh border. Our task on this two day field trip was to explore Offa’s Dyke, as well as to explore the ruins of Norman castles and churches that allude to the oppressive power dynamic created after the Norman conquest in 1066. By walking along Offa’s Dyke, once the border of England and Wales, gave us a glimpse of the Mercian landscapes of defense and the locations of the ruins demonstrated the oppression of the Welsh people under Norman rule. Finally, we journeyed back into England to Cambridge, most famous for its numerous colleges, but also known for its strong medieval connections. From Anglo-Saxon churches to incredible pre-Victorian architecture to field trips nearby, Cambridge became our last home base. Here, we were able to explore the easternmost parts of the once Mercian kingdom, while also reflecting on our entire experience on this seminar. This website is a culmination of all we have explored and experienced, providing a reflective outlet to share our thoughts as we come to the end of this journey through space and time.</p>

She is a Welsh Anglo-Saxonist, dedicated to the promotion of Medieval Studies broadly, and that’s why she chose to design “Lost in the Myths of Time: Landscape, Language and Identity”. There is nothing like being immersed in the landscape (literally, in the case of the muddy Salt Street in Appleby Parva) to understand and imagine what early medieval texts might refer to; how the Anglo-Saxons and Celts might have travelled, communicated, fought, farmed, lived and died together; and how the landscape transformed the lives of earlier generations, but was also transformed by those who passed through it.</p>
