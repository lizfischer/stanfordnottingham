###Ely
Situated in northeastern England, 14 miles northeast of Cambridge and 80 miles northeast of London, the Isle of Ely rests near the River Great Ouse as a modern cathedral city with deep medieval and Romano-British roots. There is evidence of a Roman road, now called Akeman Street, running through multiple modern cities, including Ely, alluding to Ely’s long withstanding importance. The origin and meaning of the name “Isle of Ely” has long been disputed by place-name scholars, but the most widely accepted translation of the medieval Latin Elge is “island of eels” or “eel island”, referring to the creatures caught in the River Great Ouse for food. Today, however, Ely is no longer an island in swampy fenland, as the fens were drained in the 16th century to make the once impenetrable island more accessible. The place-name lives on as a connection to the historical significance of its landscape.

While historical records of Ely date back as far as the Romano-British period, but our focus is the Anglo-Saxon times, when the Isle was controlled by the Anglo-Saxon tribe, the Gyrwas. Then, in approximately 652 C.E., the Prince of the Gyrwas, Prince Tondbert, married Princess Æthelthryth of East Anglia (one of King Onna of East Anglia’s four daughters), and presented her with the Isle of Ely as a wedding present. Why present his bride with an island in the middle of swampy fenlands? The Isle of Ely has long been regarded as an easily defendable area of land, as the physical surrounding landscape is difficult to navigate. Landscapes of defense were extremely important during the medieval period, as there was a lot of political unrest. In 673 C.E., Æthelthryth founded an abbey on the Isle of Ely, called the Church of St. Etheldreda and St. Peter. The abbey survived until 870, when the Danes destroyed the abbey and captured Ely, making it apart of Danelaw, a Viking kingdom which was comprised of the former kingdoms of East Anglia, parts of Mercia and parts of Northumbria. Then, in 970, about 16 years after the end of Viking rule in England, Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester, rebuilt the abbey in the Isle of Ely as a Benedictine abbey in his campaign to restore various religious land after Viking rule. Following William the Conqueror’s conquest of England, Ely appears in the Doomsday book as having approximately 110 households and four parishes (c. 1086). During this time, construction on a new cathedral to replace Æthelwold’s abbey had begun under the supervision of a Norman abbot, Simeon. Ely’s status as a cathedral city was granted in 1109, even though the cathedral wasn’t fully constructed until 1375. This cathedral, especially with its distinctive octagonal central tower, is considered today to be a great medieval architectural achievement.

Ely’s cathedral demonstrated much of the historical significance of the isle throughout the medieval period, but Ely contains many other areas of significance, such as Cherry Hill. At first glance, the hill today appears to provide solely a great view of Ely’s cathedral. However, following archeological excavations in the early 2000s, it is evident that Cherry Hill was once the site of Ely Castle, a motte and bailey castle that dates back to Henry I’s reign (c. 1100-1135). While the origin of motte and bailey castles are unknown, they were extremely common fortifications built across Europe form the 10th to the 13th century, comprised of a castle keep situated on a raised earthwork (motte), accompanied by an enclosed courtyard (bailey) and surrounded by a ditch and palisade. Ely Castle’s history begins with Hereward the Wake (meaning “army guard the watchful”) and his leadership of the local resistance to the Norman conquest in 1066. William the Conqueror finally defeated Hereward the Wake in the fenland surrounding Ely in 1071, and abandoned the castle. Then, during the Anarchy (1135-1154), the castle was refortified by a supported of Matilda, Bishop Nigel, until he surrendered in 1140. King Stephen then gifted the castle to Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, making him the first Earl of Essex. Ely Castle’s history comes to an obscure and abrupt end when it was destroyed in either 1216 by Falkes de Breauté or in 1268 during the Second Baron’s War, when Ely and its fortifications were captured and destroyed.

Following the medieval period, Ely disappears from the spotlight until the mid-17th century, when King Charles I ordered the fenlands to be drained for agricultural purposes. Since then, the place-name “Isle of Ely” has ceased to embody it’s meaning and has begun to reference a distant, medieval past. In the 21st century, various excavations have started to uncover the mystery of Ely’s historic past, placing most of the physical evidence recovered on public display at the Ely History Museum.
