At first glance Brixworth seems like an unremarkable English village. Located 
a few miles off the A14 road, its mom and pop stores and nestled rows of brick houses 
give it a small-town charm. However, behind this quaint scene lies the All Saints’ 
Church, one of the most significant sites of Anglo-Saxon architecture today.

Brixworth Church’s historical importance comes from the fact that despite being 
over 1300 years old, much of its original structure is still preserved today. Its lengthy 
history starts in the year 680 C.E. when the church was founded to serve a nearby monastery, 
Brixworth Abbey, which was also being constructed. The church’s style was ‘Romanesque’, 
taking numerous cues from Roman architecture such as pillars and rounded arches. Beyond 
taking stylistic choices from the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons building Brixworth Church also 
took physical materials. As a result much of the walls are built from Roman stonework and 
the arches are made of terra cotta bricks scavenged from nearby ruins of Roman settlements. These terra cotta arches are distinctly Anglo-Saxon due to their ‘herringbone’ construction, 
where an arch is formed from many long, thin bricks stacked radially so their largest faces 
are touching.  Another point of architectural significance in the church’s original design 
was the inclusion of several features not generally seen in church architecture until 
centuries later.  One example of this is the ambulatory, a walled-off walkway that winds 
around the back of the church’s outside. 

This initial construction is not entirely the same as what we see today however, as 
Brixworth Church has undergone several alterations over the years.  The first of these was 
during the Danish invasion of 870, when Vikings dismantled parts of the church and completely 
destroyed the associated monastery.  The church remained in disrepair for almost 100 years 
until it was reconstructed in 960 to become a parish church under the reign of Saxon King Edgar. This reconstruction reduced the church’s size, removing two side aisles that originally flanked 
the central nave.  The builders also added a stair turret above the western entrance, which is 
now one of four remaining Anglo-Saxon turrets.  The next changes that occurred to the church were 
by the Normans, who added an aisle and chapel on the church’s south side and increased the height 
of the stair turret with a large spire.  Brixworth church was used in this form until the 19th 
century, when it was reached by the nationwide Victorian movement to restore ancient buildings. The Victorians made a substantial effort to stay faithful to the church’s original design, which 
was fortunate as restorations in other places (such as the Roman baths) were far from accurate.  
They removed most of the Norman additions and dug down to the original level of the ambulatory, 
exposing a large amount of Anglo-Saxon stonework. The fruits of their labors are what the church 
looks like today – a monument to Anglo-Saxon construction that has stayed intact for over a 
millennia.

Our group’s visit to Brixworth was short but eventful. We explored the inside of the 
church, looking at the various eras of stonework and stained glass as well as getting a 
demonstration of the building’s acoustics via a hymn sung by the vicar.  After this we ventured 
outside to walk around the exterior, looking at the graveyard, ambulatory, and turret.
