Montgomery, Wales—also known by its Welsh name Trefaldwyn—is a small border town between England and Wales located in the administrative district of Powys. The earliest attestation of _Montgomeri_ comes from the Domesday Book in 1086 and lent itself to the naming of its county, Montgomeryshire. The two sites of historical significance we visited in this town were the remains of its castle and its St. Nicholas Parish Church.  

A two-day stop in our overall journey, the small town of Montgomery facilitated our immersion into the concept of borders and purpose for human settlements. As we explored the Montgomery castle and St. Nicholas Church, we witnessed the survival of manmade structures which represent borders’ role in cultural battles. Both iterations of this town’s name—Montgomery and Trefaldwyn—originate from the Norman conquest and reflect the area’s possession.

The Welsh place-name _Trefaldwyn_, which translates to “the town of Baldwin” refers to Norman adventurer Baldwin de Bollers who gained the Montgomery Castle in 1102. On the other hand, _Montgomery_ originates from the Norman Lord Roger de Montgomery who named the castle after his other castle in Montgomery, Normandy; this castle name lent itself to the surrounding town.

The building of this castle from which the town derives its name—in 1223 by Henry III—was a replacement of the earlier Motte and Bailey fortification at Henderson two miles away. The structure’s objective was to function as a frontline fortress guarding the Welsh border region. As such, a long history of battles for control surrounds this small town. Although the town was sacked and burned by the Welsh forces of Owain Glyn Dŵr in 1402, Montgomery Castle survived until 1643 when it was surrendered to Parliamentary forces in the English Civil War and damaged beyond repair. Thus, our visit was to the ruins of Montgomery Castle as opposed to a preserved specimen.

As for our other historical sight visit in Montgomery, St. Nicholas Parish Church is a well-preserved symbol of Norman influence on Montgomery and their possession of the land. With its thick walls and thin windows, St. Nicholas’ church was a fortified structure built in 1227 and—as suggested by its name—is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Originally, Montgomery’s church was included in the parish of Chirbury until the dissolution of this system. Unlike the destroyed castle, the church building survives and its use is maintained until modern day. Thus, cultural influences of Norman conquest is far more long-standing than the overt oppressive structures such as the castles.

This segment of our journey was a pleasant stay in Montgomery’s quiet town witnessing the lasting effects of border relations and Norman conquest. Clambering around the castle remains, admiring the church’s preservation, and exploring the small town gave us all the uniquely immersive experience of conceptualizing a true border town and its structures’ purposes.
