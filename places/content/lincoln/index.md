The earliest settlement found on the site of present day Lincoln is of a 1st c. BCE hill fort surrounding brayford pool, know as Lindon. This pool is where the first part of Lincoln’s name comes from - _lind_ is a brittonic word for “pool”, and “don” is a hill with a flat top - an ideal place for settlements and castles. Compare this etymology to Dublin, from _dubh linn_, meaning black pool. One prominent find from this are from this era is the Witham shield (now held by the British Museum), a unique Iron Age bronze shield backing of Celtic design

After the Roman Conquest, Lindon was resettled as _Colonia Domitiana Lindensium_, eventually shortened to _Lindum Colonia_, with a fort constructed on top of the hill in 60 CE. This is the source for the second half of the modern place name - Latinized ‘lindon’ to ‘lindum,’ and Colonia, roman word for a colony, specifically a settlement of Roman military, forces and their associated families, attached after the status was changed from fort to colony around 86 CE. Lincoln was linked to the larger empire by the Fosse Way, a main thoroughfare that linked Exeter in the southwest of England to Lincoln in the northeast. 182 miles long, the Fosse Way is almost always straight, and its name comes from the Latin word _fossa_, meaning ditch - making it possible that earthworks preceded or accompanied the road. After a few centuries of development, Lincoln shrank from prominence after the 4th century, subdued after an invasion by Picts in 387.

After Roman rule collapsed in 446, Lincoln began its evolution into a medieval city under Anglo Saxon rule. It lay within the Kingdom of Mercia, and maintained important strategic connections to the sea. It’s first interaction with Vikings was in 839, followed by Viking settlement in the area in 876. It subsequently passed between Saxon and Viking control until the solidification of Viking power in 1013. During this period, Latin name was affected by Old English, changing first into Lindocolina, then Lincylene. The name of Breyford pool originates from this time period, from _Breit-ford_, a place where a river is fordable. Emerged by the end of the period as a major trading center, despite decline in the 10th century. 

Lincoln’s status was raised after the Norman invasion by William the Conqueror in 1066., and it eventually became the third most prominent city under Norman rule. In 1072 William the Conqueror ordered construction of Lincoln Castle, on the same site as the Roman Hill fort and Iron Age settlement, and in 1088 Lincoln Cathedral was begun.

In more recent years, Lincoln had a wool trade that flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries, and the color associated with the area is Lincoln Green - of the type Robin Hood is said to have worn (dyed with blue woad and yellow weld). In addition, in 1916 first ever tanks designed and built in Lincoln, and used in WWI first as a way to overcome areas with barbed wire. Much of Lincoln’s past is recorded in the The Collection, which we visited to see archeological artifacts dating back to prehistoric times, with an emphasis on the Viking era ones by Dr. Christina Lee from the University of Nottingham.

###Lincoln Castle

The word castle is a from the roman castellum, the diminutive form of castrum, meaning “small fortified place.” This is one of only two castles with two mottes (these are large mounds with towers or other buildings on them, visible as part of the south side of the wall), and one of best preserved Castles in England, which formed a network for Norman exertion of control over the countryside. It’s walls are still in existence, ditches present on the west side, and a gaol has been present and operated from the 12th c. to 20th c. Visiting today, it provides an example of the harsh “separate system” of imprisonment which emphasized minimal human contact (evident even in the high, divided pews in the church).

In addition, Lincoln castle holds one of only 4 surviving copies of the original Magna Carta (Lincolnia - to lincoln - is written on the back of this one). Bishop of Lincoln, Hugh Wells, one of the witnesses of the Magna Carta when it was signed, and made sure one was sent back to Lincoln. While 2 years ago was the 800th anniversary, this year (2017) is the 800th anniversary for the signing of the Charter of the Forest (1217), done by King Henry II to reaffirm portions of the Magna Carta and reestablish rights relating to forests - only two copies of this survive. When we visited, the Domesday book was also on display, in a rare opportunity to see it outside London. Commissioned in 1085, and finished in 1086, this was William the Conqueror’s survey of his new domain and provides a comprehensive account of the land, who it was owned by, what it contained, and approximate value - and is one of the most valuable source for early attestations of placenames.

###Lincoln Cathedral

Construction began in 1088, and moved in fits and starts throughout the medieval period, though first version was completed in 1092. It is built of Lincolnshire oolitic limestone opposite the castle in the south-east corner. Between 1311 and 1549, tallest building in the world, until its central spire (of wood encased by lead) blew down in a storm; its previous height is generally accepted as 525 feet (beating the Pyramid of Giza at 481 feet).

It has beautiful and intriguing architectural features, including two major rose windows, and asymmetrical vaults. It also hosts the Wren Library which houses rare collections, including the works of the Venerable Bede, famous for his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. It takes its name from Sir Christopher Wren, a late 17th century architect known for designing St. Paul’s cathedral and the facade for Hampton court.
