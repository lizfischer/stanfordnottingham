Sherwood Forest, located 20 miles north of Nottingham, is a country park known for being the home of the legendary Robin Hood.  The first recorded spelling of Sherwood was ‘Shiryuda’ or ‘Shirwuda’ in a 958 boundary clause granting land to an archbishop.  Up until the Norman conquest of 1066, the land had been used as farmland by local communities.  Then it was designated a “Royal Hunting Forest” where the legal term, “forest,” meant that many of its resources, especially timber, were protected.  Local workers, who were also employed by the king, strictly enforced these laws.  By the 12th century, Sherwood Forest comprised 100,000 acres and made up 1/5th of Nottinghamshire.  

Sherwood Forest is most well-known, by far, for being the stomping grounds of Robin Hood.  There are varying dates for when Robin Hood lived, ranging from 1160 to 1322, and the first written stories of Robin Hood came during the late 14th century and continued to develop well into the 16th century.  However stories may have been told orally before this, and then weren’t written down until later, which gives rise to the possibility that Robin Hood was a real person.  Robin Hood was certainly a common name for the time, but it is more likely that the tale developed from many robbers of the time.

An important feature of Sherwood Forest and the stories of Robin Hood was the Great North Way – the main road connecting York to London.  It is unclear today where exactly this road passed through Sherwood Forest, but it probably delimitated two counties.  It was known as being dangerous due to the many robbers who would prey on passerby.  These “outlaws” got there name from living “outside the law” and a boundary would have been the perfect place to carry out their illegal activities.

Another major landmark associated with Robin Hood is the Major Oak in the middle of the park.  This massive tree is over 800 years old and has been a tourist attraction since the 19th century.  The Major Oak is impressive in its size, weighing 23 tons, with a circumference of 33 feet and its branches spreading out to 92 feet.  In the mid-1800s, the tree was called Cockpen tree, due to its place near old cock fights. 

Along with visiting the Major Oak, we also hiked over 2 miles to see Thynghowe.  Now only a small ridge covered in ferns, Thynghowe was a Viking assembly site on the border of three parishes.  The name ‘Thynghowe’ is possibly derived from Old Norse _thing_ (meaning ‘governing assembly’) and _howe_ (referring to a prehistoric burial mound).

Up until the Dissolution of 1536, Sherwood Forest continued to supply resources for the king.  After this, however, former land used for abbeys was sold to private estates and by the 1700s, the former forest was privately owned by 5 main families.  Eventually the former forest was sold to smaller and smaller landowners until 1969.  This was when Sherwood Forest was declared a country park of 37 acres.  Since then, public facilities and more land have been added to the park.  Today, Sherwood Forest Country Park is 450 acres with an annual visitor population of over 350,000.
