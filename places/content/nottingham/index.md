Known to the Britons as _Tigguo Cobauc_ (“Place of Caves”) and the Saxons as Snotingaham (“the homestead of Snot’s people”), Nottingham is an ancient city that has been shaped by many different peoples and cultures throughout the centuries. Perhaps the city is most famous today as the home of the legendary Robin Hood, along with landmarks such as Nottingham Castle and Sherwood Forest. During our one-week stay at the University of Nottingham, we also had the opportunity to meet and learn from a host of wonderful people including Jayne Carroll, Christina Lee, John Baker, and Stuart Brookes, and a cohort of friendly master’s students. 

Under Jayne’s tutelage we examined the role of boundary clauses in the evolution of place-names, and thought about how names—and indeed, identities—are relative. We looked at the Domesday book, maps both medieval and contemporary, and ordinance surveys, and thought about how these texts might be seen not as simple record-keeping but as acts of colonial acquisition and conquest. We examined individual place-names themselves and saw how each one represents a sedimentation of history, rich with the fossilised remnants of words used by people who lived here in medieval and ancient times.

Antibiotic resistance is currently one of, if not the most, serious threat to modern human beings at the moment. In 2014, a World Health Organization report stated that antibiotic resistance “is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world.” This is where Christina’s research comes into play—she and a team of specialists in biology and medieval studies succeeded in using Anglo-Saxon recipes to treat eye infections caused by bacteria. As the behemoth of the modern pharmaceutical industry stagnates in solving critical issues, it may well be small-scale, interdisciplinary, university-level projects like Christina’s that will lead to viable solutions. And, of course, expertise in medieval studies.

Outside of the classroom, we have a wonderful time exploring the university campus and city itself.
