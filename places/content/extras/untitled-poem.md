<pre>Back against an outcropping of rock
Feet dangling over the edge
Surveying the green expanses below.

I sit surrounded by the remains of the past.
Ruins of what once was…
A castle’s stones, a worn-down path
The perpetual green that permeates this land.

Cattle grazing on a landscape
Preserved for thousands of years.

Wind whipping civilizations’ past
As we stubbornly persist in our existence.

Stone and green’s eternal battle,
The fate of which humans determine
And their ancestors witness.</pre>
