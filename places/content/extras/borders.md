<pre>The line that runs 	between here and there
Neither here nor there, 	transitional land
That dares to divide 	yet somehow shares
This sense of belonging 	yet feels alone, and
Threatens to rob you of home	—contemplate: marginalization.
Yet, the border offers 		a chance to be yourself.

When I walk across this 	line drawn in the sand
I wonder who drew 	this line and said,
“To the east is this 	and the west is that,
and never shall the 	two have chance to meet,”
Except that this line 	in the sand is both,
Both east and west; 	and it is here I stand
Feeling utterly lost 	and utterly proud
Choosing to be present  	and precise in knowing
that I am who I am  	no matter where I am.</pre>
