Sweet, simple, soft;
sweeping silver green moss.

Murky, muddy, mellow;
milky meadow of yellow.

Crisp, crunchy, clear;
crafty creatures in fields near.

Thirsty, thriving, tough;
thickets too rough.

Brisk, bleak, bulk;
bunches and bushes of brambles.

Paths of old
for travelers anew,
sights seen before
and yet never seen.
But what still remains
from the time of the Danes
are the keen
fifty shades of green.
