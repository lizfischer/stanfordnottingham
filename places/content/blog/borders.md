As we sat in a Nottingham classroom that first week, one of the seminar’s motifs emerged: to what extent were borders physical barriers and what lasting affects did the presence of this concept have. In class and then in-situ, we pondered these arbitrary lines-in-the-sand’s effect on cultural development and their dependence on communal knowledge and relative perspectives of the land. These conversations emulated the borders we discussed as they focused on our cooperative conceptualization despite having set distinctions made by readings. (ie: “Borders” by Elaine Treharne)

Anglo-Saxon borders—like our conversations—had a basis in boundaries established by authority; for these physical borders, this authorization came via boundary clauses incorporated into land charters. Yet, in practice both our conversations and the borders were dependent upon a community’s mutual understandings which interpreted what was originally described by higher authority.

Borders were boundaries distinguishing between hides of land, counties, and kingdoms. Yet, these territorial divisions were far from the only purpose of borders. In our discussions boundaries were the rule as borders where the broader concept which surrounded these physical distinctions. (For more on our experiences with boundaries see Clare Tandy’s entry.) A border, rather than being merely the identified boundaries of an estate, was the land between two distinct places which had the potential to take on qualities of both or become an entity all its own. Everything about borders was dependent on their enforcement and the individual perspective on them as a concept.

As we walked down Salt Street and traversed that muddy trail, at one point we crossed over the M42 motorway on a bridge positioned between two signs. One read “Welcome to Leicestershire” and the other “Warwickshire Shakespeare’s County”. These were demarcations of the boundaries of each of these counties respectively, yet we were caught in between. Administratively, some unmarked line in the middle of that bridge splits the counties jurisdictions, but in that moment, it felt as if we were standing in the border and existed outside of any specific county.

Such place names as No Man’s Heath imply similar concepts of borders in the Anglo-Saxon times. Lands between distinct boundaries existed and held specific roles in society just as structures created on the fringes of a county or a kingdom had specific purposes. These were distinct to the individual structures and borders but could be generally described as oppressive power plays in the case of border structures and neutral meeting zones for the borders and lands in-between them.

Of course, our discussions went beyond finding the simple explanation of borders in the Anglo-Saxon age. We thought of borders as much more than some historically significant piece of land or the charter that defines it, but as a concept applicable to modern-day lives and comparable to our own experiences. From the border between Wales and England to our shared dorm rooms, borders and the separation of one landscape into multiple areas results in shifting perspectives and complex interrelations between parties involved. Once areas are labeled on paper, the practice of using previous common spaces and negotiating the neutrality or possession of borderlands is a fascinating process dependent on community understandings and power balances.
