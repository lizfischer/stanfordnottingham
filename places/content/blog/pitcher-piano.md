Attending church on Sunday morning is a common activity in Nottingham, and Sunday brunch after church seems to be another long standing tradition. What if you could combine both activities? Well, a small section of our larger group stumbled upon Pitcher&amp;Piano on a Sunday morning after missing breakfast in the Nottingham University dining hall. We were
extremely intrigued by the idea of a restaurant, pub, and caf√© being inside a restored 13th century church in the historic Lace Market. Additionally, this hidden gem came highly recommended by various Nottingham natives. What we were not told is how absolutely breathtaking the church was, both inside and outside.

We were seated at a quaint little table underneath a huge Victorian-era stained glass window on the east end of the historic nave. The breakfast menu, while not extensive, was full of various options to satisfy vegetarians, gluten intolerants, and carnivores alike. I ordered the avocado and egg on toast, which was absolutely delicious. After many a breakfast of extra buttery eggs with greasy hash browns, a freshly toasted piece of bread with a poached egg, avocado, and tomato was exactly what the doctor ordered. In addition, the Americano coffee was delicious, both the first and second time I ordered it. Others had only positive things to say about their maple-bacon potato hash and Americanos.

After breakfast, I stayed behind with Hayley to work on our various assignments. We decided to explore upstairs, getting incredible views of the church and stained glass windows from all angles. The staff, all of whom were extremely friendly and accommodating, cleaned all of the upstairs tables so we could have a choice of where we wanted to sit. We spent almost as much time working as we did admiring the church itself, which combined a hipster, San Francisco vibe with a strong historical presence. Then, for me, the icing on the cake was having a live pianist serenade the pub with beautiful covers of popular songs, including a few songs in Spanish. Overall, I wish I had spent every morning, noon, and night in the Pitcher&amp;Piano. 

If you ever find yourself in Nottingham, this a definite must-see.
