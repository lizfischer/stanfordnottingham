Let’s be honest. You don’t travel to the United Kingdom in search of the best cup of coffee. You travel here to experience history, which, in our case, meant traveling to small towns not often frequented by foreigners to experience Medieval landscapes and history. However, a good cup of joe is a morning essential, with or without jet lag. Unfortunately, outside of London, it seemed as though “coffee” was a word as foreign as our American accents.

Day one was a rough day for us. After a particularly filling and lengthy first supper together as a group on Sunday evening, we were set to start at 10 Monday morning. Normally, 10 in the morning would be a reasonable hour to begin class, however, given the jet lag, it was rather early in the morning. Our first realization that were weren’t in Kansas anymore, so to speak, was the dining hall coffee dispenser. Hayley was brave enough to try the straight espresso from the strange machine, while I opted for the “coffee” option. Neither of us were pleased when we saw hot water poured into our tiny mugs, followed by a thimble-full of questionable brown liquid. They both tasted worse than they sound. Thus, our quest for a decent, passable, maybe-not-revolting, and heavily caffeinated cup of joe was born.

####Nottingham

#####Starbucks 

Could we get any more basic? Probably. It was a blessing to find a Starbucks on campus in the building next to our classroom. It was also a blessing that Hayley introduced me to the world of Americanos after I had the weakest latte ever on day one (following the dining hall coffee dispenser, of course). While the Americanos are the University Starbucks were not up to the typical Starbucks standard, in both flavor and caffeine effect, they were the saving grace of our first seven days in the United Kingdom. All in all, the Nottingham University Starbucks Americano was a passable and not-revolting cup of coffee.

#####Pitcher&Piano

It seems appropriate, as this pub resides in a converted 13th century church, to say thank God the Nottingham University Starbucks was not open on Sunday. After a late night out on the town on Saturday, it goes without saying that in order to accomplish any amount of work on Sunday, a strong cuppa was extremely necessary. Pitcher&Piano, a short tram ride away and tucked into the historic Lace Market district of downtown Nottingham, was a godsend as far as food (10/10 recommend the avocado toast and the maple bacon potato hash) and coffee. Again, we ordered Americanos, and, after an almost too long wait, our prayers were answered. While the mugs were small and two Americanos were needed to reach maximum working efficiency, the ambiance of the building and the robust flavor of the coffee made the visit more than worthwhile. (*insert picture*)

#### Lincoln

#####The Collection 

The museum was incredible, demonstrating much of the local history of Lincoln as a Medieval Viking settlement, and even gives visitors the ability to dress up as a member of the ancient Roman nobility, an Anglo-Saxon woman, a Medieval warrior, or a 13th century warrior. However, the caffe, which is beautifully decorated, serves probably some of the worst coffee, tasting only just better than the Nottingham coffee dispenser. Apart from the grounds in my coffee, the flavor was that of burnt, bitter espresso, making the Americano I ordered almost undrinkable. However, when you’re operating on 5 hours of sleep, caffeine takes priority over taste.

#### Montgomery

#####Dragon Hotel
Our trip to a small village in Wales was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, for both historical reasons and for the amazing drip coffee served every morning from 7:30 to 9:30. Aside from the sweeping countryside views, Offa’s Dyke, and too many sheep, the coffee made by the sweet staff of the Dragon Hotel was a highlight of our trip to Montgomery, Wales. The mugs were unnecessarily tiny, but after about three mugs of the delicious American-style brewed coffee, we were ready for the day. If you ever find yourself on the border of England and Wales in need of a caffeine fix, don’t hesitate to stop at the Dragon Hotel.

####Clun, England.

If you haven’t heard of it, don’t worry. It is quite off the beaten track on the England-side of Offa’s Dyke. It is a village smaller than Montgomery, with only one main country road running through the middle of town, right in front of the White Horse Inn. After a sack lunch up near the ruins of Clun’s Anglo-Saxon castle, the group retreated from the outdoors to the White Horse Inn, where we were all pleasantly surprised by the high quality Americanos we were given. For a mere £1.80, you could get a large (16 oz) Americano that was strong without leaving you with a bitter aftertaste. While the owner of the pub and residence of Clun were not the friendliest to outsiders, the bar tender was very kind. Overall, 10/10 would recommend.

####Cambridge

#####The Royal Cambridge Hotel
