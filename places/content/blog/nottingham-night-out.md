As seminar guests at the University of Nottingham, we had experienced the city as both international students, through onsite lectures amid relics and manuscripts, and as tourists, through our trips to the Nottingham Castle and Caves. Since Sunday morning promised our first proper lie-in, we decided Saturday was the best time to experience the nightlife as a local.

After sorting through recommendations from the local graduate student population, we decided on three of Nottingham’s most promising destinations: 

 1. Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem
 2. Tilt Bar
 3. Coco Tang

####Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem

Fun Fact: The *ye* in “Ye Olde” is actually an anachronistic translation of ![](img/ye.png)(or *þe*), pronounced ‘the.’
Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem claims to be the oldest inn in England, with an est. date of 1189 AD. This neighborhood pub is built directly into the sandstone underneath Nottingham Castle. The sandstone walls, homey décor, and quirky games create a truly unique experience for the casual pub-goer. 
We decided to test our newly minted Anglo-Saxon navigational skills by riding the train from the University Station to the City Centre. From the City Centre, we followed Maid Marian Way to Nottingham Castle, and we followed the castle walls until we saw the welcoming sign of Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem. Had we arrived earlier, we could have taken the weekly ghost tour—a ½ mile walk that includes the details of the pub’s haunted chair and cursed galleon. We seated ourselves among the many outdoor guests and relaxed in the friendly neighborhood feel of the pub before venturing to our next destination.

Tilt Bar is a multi-level “blues cocktail bar” offering one-of-a-kind drink recipes and live blues music.
From Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem, we made our way back to the City Centre and followed Long Row until it turned to Pelham Street. If we weren’t looking for it, we would have missed the inconspicuous entrance—fortunately, we noticed the well-dressed and kindly bouncers. Our group of nine took over a table on the third story, near the musicians, and we settled in to enjoy an hour of Nottingham blues.

You wouldn’t know if from the [website]( http://www.cocotang.co.uk/), or maybe you would, but The House of Coco Tang is a basement dance club-turned-wonderland that instantly transports you to the heart of the European Disco. Our graduate friends had promised us “very Eurotrash, very fun,” and we were not disappointed. 
Again, if it weren’t for the well-dressed and friendly bouncers, we might have missed the entrance. We followed Pelham Street back to High Street, and cut through to Bridlesmith Gate via Victoria Street. There was no line when we got to the door (we arrived at the ripe and early time of 11 PM), but one started forming behind us as the bouncers looked over our American IDs and happily let us know there were more of our kind (“From Virginia!”) inside already. The space was constructed of two bars cut down the middle by a mostly empty dance floor. At first our only dance partners were the Virginians, but as the hour passed the floor filled in with the rest of Nottingham’s European disco lovers. We learned a few new moves and showed off plenty of our own! We left at midnight to grab some late-night chips before cabbing back to the University. 
All in all, our night out in Nottingham was an immersive success. We enjoyed neighborhood favorites, listened to wonderful music, and danced up a sweat with the locals. Weekend nights in Nottingham are filled shoulder-to-shoulder with pub-goers, hen parties, and disco dancers. The wide array of restaurants and clubs promises something for everyone. 10/10 would go again!
