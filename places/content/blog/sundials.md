A question came up as we were studying place-names through boundary charters. We noticed that most Anglo-Saxon boundary clauses seem to outline boundaries by starting at a corner and moving clockwise through the landscape. We wondered how and if the Anglo-Saxons standardized spatial directionality and if things just happened to be clockwise or if there was a reason or medieval equivalent for the term. We hypothesized that always turning right and the influence of sundials had something to do with it. In my initial research, I was brought back to the link between language and time/space metaphors, a concept I studied in a linguistics class at Stanford. Different cultures linguistically express time and space in ways that reveal how speakers of the language think about directionality and space. So how did the Anglo-Saxons conceive of space and talk about direction?   

The term sunwise appears in Celtic language, especially with the Scots and Irish. The influence of Celtic religious ceremonies that correlated with the movement of the sun may have been influential in thinking of things as moving with the sun in the British Isles. When sundials came into use in Britain, the people did follow the direction of the sun much as we would use the term clockwise to describe direction today. In the Northern hemisphere, the sun and modern clocks do move in the same direction. There were also superstitions about the left originating from ancient religious beliefs. So, whether it be that boundary clauses were usually sunwise, or merely just comprised of right handed turns out of cultural normality due to superstition concerning the left, there does seem to be reason for why Anglo-Saxon boundary clauses follow a clockwise path. However, in Anglo-Saxon Britain, while Celtic influence may have played a role in establishing a sunwise norm, the term sunwise isn't common until later in the medieval period and thus it is more likely that they preferred a right-ward way of life.
