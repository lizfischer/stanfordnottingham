London is the current capital and most populous city in England, located along the River Thames.  A global center of commerce, London was founded by the Romans in 43 C.E. as Londinium and quickly became a major commercial and administrative center in Roman Britain.  Located at the site of the modern City of London, this initially low-ranking settlement gained its strategic importance as a nexus of trade from its position alongside a Roman bridge crossing the Thames.  At the time, the city was the only location at which the Thames could be both crossed by land and navigated by ship.  After being sacked by the nearby Brittonic Iceni tribe in 60AD, the city was rebuilt as a planned town and by the late 1st century had grown to be Britain’s largest city.

The city thrived as a center of commercial and military activity into the late 2nd century, during which time construction was begun and was later completed on the London Wall, a defensive fortification encircling the city.  The city remained a major settlement through the tumultuous last few centuries of the Roman Empire, until its abandonment in the late 5th century following the Anglo-Saxon invasions and the empire’s collapse.  The city was ruined and left uninhabited for almost 400 years.

While the ruins within the city walls remained untouched, the Anglo-Saxons did construct a new settlement, called Lundenwic (-wic : settlement, village), less than one mile away at the current site of the City of Westminster.  Given its strategic location, it was not long until Lundenwic in turn became a major commercial center; in the early 8th century, Bede noted the city as a “trading center for many nations who visit it by land and sea”.  Originally incorporated into the Anglo Saxon kingdom of Essex, Lundenwic fell under Mercian control during the Mercian supremacy, then was disputed between Mercia and Wessex following the death of King Offa.  The city survived a series of raids during the Viking invasions, but by 871 had fallen under Viking control.  

In 886, however, under the leadership of Alfred of Wessex, the Anglo-Saxons regained control of London, this time reestablishing the city as Lundenburh (-_burh_ : fortified dwelling place belonging to a king or lord) inside the still-standing Roman walls.  The city was to remain a continuous and major settlement through the Norman conquest and into the present day.

London has presented one of the more difficult etymological puzzles in English place-name studies, as it is difficult to trace the origins of the Roman name Londinium.  The earliest attempt at an explanation, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, attributed the name to a Brittonic King Lud, but this account is now considered fictitious.  The most recent attempt to explain the name traces it to Brittonic _Lowonidonjon_, a place-name thought to derive from the Pre-Celtic _plowonida_, meaning “river too wide to ford” and the British suffix -_on-jon_.  However, it is still difficult to explain the later mutation into Londinium. 

On our trip to London, we visited both the British Library and the British Museum.  At the Library, we were treated to a tour of the Library’s exhibition of rare manuscripts, notably the Codex Sinaiticus and one of four extant copies of Magna Carta.  Later that afternoon, we focused on exploring the Museum’s collection of artifacts found at the Sutton Hoo burials sites.
