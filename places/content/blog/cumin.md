While in Nottingham, we went to an Indian restaurant called The Cumin. On arriving, we were lead to a private room upstairs. The room seemed very sophisticated, with a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. All sixteen of us sat down a long table hungry, after walking all afternoon around Nottingham to see the caves. Like all our other dining experiences, we had been presented with an abundance of food. We started with an assortment of appetisers, and then had the main course, which consisted of rice and chicken and potato curries with naan bread.

There had been many new experiences for me during the trip, and the Indian food was one of them. I wasnâ€™t too sure about what the food be would like, but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed everything that I tried, especially the chicken curry.

My favorite part of the meal, however was the dessert. Everyone ordered a dessert that they wanted. I had trouble deciding what I wanted, because all the items on the dessert seemed really good. After a few minutes of considering a cheesecake and coconut ice cream, I decided to go with the latter. When it arrived, it looked wonderful. The ice cream  had been served in a coconut shell and topped with a light drizzle of caramel and a date. The first bite that I had was absolutely delightful. It was soft and creamy and tasted like actual coconut.

Overall the food was delicious and a great introduction to Indian food and would love to return.
