We were finishing our tour of Ely Cathedral when our guide, Pam, pointed out to us a small Victorian woodcarving of St. Audrey. To the right of it was a heavy red rope, attached to the seats on either side.

After pointing out the carving, she gestured up to the back of the area at one of the remaining misericord - commenting how she wished we could see it close up, but she (and by extension, we) was not allowed to go behind the rope.

Borders and boundaries that shape human behavior, either by compliance or rebellion, has been a reoccurring theme throughout this trip. This rope was a small example of the type of boundary that does not physically stop you from going somewhere, but expresses clear intentions nonetheless. Any of us could have walked up to it, unhooked it, and marched on up to have a look at the seat ourselves, but no one made any move towards it and instead wandered off to the stained glass museum or the gift shop. Even the idea of so clearly breaking an established boundary feels wrong to me as I wrote this.

Why does this feeling emerge? The repercussions for this transgression would be minor:  “you’re not supposed to be there, come down,” followed by the ever-present British, “please.” Yet the feeling of crossing that boundary, acknowledging it was there, was enough to keep us all on one side. When we visited Brixworth, Dr. Treharne suggested to Cole that he proclaim his five minute presentation from the pulpit. When we arrived, we walked in to the vicar and a volunteer having set up a “Mums and tots” community time - and we all silently acknowledged he would most assuredly not be presenting from the pulpit. Their gaze, and their presence, made more solid a transient boundary.

In Montgomery the hotel we were staying in was a whopping .3 miles below the ruins of an old castle, stated as being open from 10am-9pm. Or at least the gate to the car park was open during these times. 

A good portion of us wound up visiting the castle outside these hours, clambering either into or out of the area over the rickety wooden gate that was locked with a chain and padlock. This, in a lot of ways, was a clearer boundary that a velvet rope - with marked signs saying the car park was only open certain hours, and a visible change in the level of access. But perhaps it was this change that made the boundary seem more permeable. Some of us spent an evening writing on the hill, overlooking the Welsh border, past the hour of 9pm, subsequently coming out to find the gates locked. If they didn't bother (and who they are is another matter) to check that we were still there, would we have any reason to suspect they minded us being there? Instead of staring at use as we picked our way among plush biblical figures to the sound of cheerful Christian children's songs, those establishing the boundary removed themselves to cups of tea and sleep.

Time of day must have played a role as well, where on the edges of daylight transgression becomes more acceptable. Power walking up the hill at 4:45 am, hearing the chorus of “baaas” and chirps emanating from the surrounding wildlife in hopes of seeing a sunrise totally obscured by clouds felt both mildly rebellious and totally justifiable. It was light, we were behaving in all other ways perfectly acceptably - sitting quietly staying out at the landscape, not shouting or drinking. We just weren't quite where we were supposed to be, and all walked a little more quickly on the way back.

Perhaps it was the ecclesiastical aura, a feeling of being watched in a sacred place that added weight to the velvet rope, while the days of marching through fields and over stiles in the open air, the wanderable countryside, made the wooden gate seem inviting. Freedom of movement and use of the land has long been a subject of contention in the British isles, from the reservation by Norman lords in kings of private hunting grounds - apparent in our visit to Sherwood Forest - to the enclosure acts that started in 1604 - so perhaps our after hours visits were more in the spirit of accessing the communal land than crossing into somewhere forbidden. 

However, the boundaries we were willing to cross are perhaps more influenced by temporal circumstances than we are willing to admit. The boundary, in all these cases, is only as strong as the power behind its enforcement, and that power comes from the people or other animated forces in charge of patrolling it. We comply or resist boundaries not just on the basis of where or what they are, but how likely we are to get into trouble if we get caught crossing them - and that relies on the people who make them.
