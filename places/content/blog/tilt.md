As the first week of the seminar was wrapping up and the move to Wales was drawing close, a couple members of our group left the dorm on a Saturday night to see what Nottingham’s city center had to offer. While our travels that night took us to several places, one place that stood out in particular was Tilt, a blues club/bar we popped into for an hour or so.

The entirety of Tilt’s interior had a wonderful hole-in- the-wall, old-school blues aesthetic going on. This was aided by the somewhat awkward shape of the building, being comprised of several floors that were long and thin. As such getting to the top level (where the live music was) involved clambering up flights of wooden staircases and shuffling through dimly-lit corridors, walls decorated with posters and records from blues greats such as Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf.

Upon reaching the top floor, our group was greeted with a bustling bar surrounded by a number of tables – all packed with patrons. Managing to snag a table off in the corner our group sat down to take a look at the menu. The bar at Tilt boasted an impressive variety of cocktails, drawing from a combination of original creations and classics with a twist. One of these modified standards that was particularly good was the Hemmingway Daiquiri, a daiquiri with grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur thrown in.

Completing Tilt’s ambiance was the live show going on in the corner, courtesy of Martin Sanders and The Mercenaries. The four piece group was comprised of a bass player, drummer, and two guitarists – one of which was on vocals as well. Sanders’ group played a set of stripped-down blues tunes, their slow tempos and soulful lyrics reminiscent of the Chicago blues tradition. Their performance combined with the background chatter of those sitting around the bar created a relaxed yet fun atmosphere for our group during the time we spent there, and Tilt was overall a unique yet enjoyable experience.
