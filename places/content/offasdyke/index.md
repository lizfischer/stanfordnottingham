On our seminar, we traveled through the landscape of the Welsh-English border walking five miles of the length of Offaâ€™s Dyke near Montgomery, Wales. We began at the top of a hill and were surprised to find the dyke rather mixed with the landscape and not in its own right a very obvious feature. However, when one considers how the medieval Welsh would have approached the monument one can imagine that the Dyke was quite imposing. Considering that the earthwork has stood the test of time and retained its impressive stature in many parts, it was a fascinating experience to weave through the countryside and imagine what the impact of such a border might have been a thousand years ago. 

Offa's Dyke is a medieval earthwork that runs the length of a large portion of the border between England and Wales. Thought to have been primarily constructed by King Offa of Mercia in the 8th century, the dyke served as a boundary between the Welsh and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, though its origin and intended purpose is a matter of considerable debate. Recent archaeology and ever-evolving scholarship on the dyke seem to further muddy the waters. What we do know, though, is that it is a very old construction that has potential political, diplomatic, and agro-economical functions and more or less once separated the Kingdom of Mercia from the border region of Wales.   

Whether or not Offa's Dyke is correctly associated with King Offa of Mercia is a topic of considerable disagreement and various hypotheses. King Offa may have commissioned its construction as a military defense, or even offense, a political boundary, or as a monument to his greatness. The name Offa may also have derived from a legendary powerful king or be a misnomer altogether. If King Offa did build the dyke, it can be supposed that he had the influence and resources to gather the needed tools and labor force to complete such an undertaking and puts the construction date between 757 and 796 AD. The dyke runs over 100 miles from north to south throughout the border region of Wales and Mercia. It consists of a ditch and rampart structure with the ditch side facing the Welsh and at its largest points eight meters high from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the banks. In some places, the earthwork is 27 meters wide. While much of the dyke has eroded, or been destroyed, there are parts of it at which its scale and engineering are truly impressive.   

Asser, King Alfred's biographer, was the first to mention the dyke and attribute it to Offa writing that Offa has constructed a dyke running nearly from 'sea to sea.' Scholarship seems to prefer that the purpose of the wall was to make a political statement and serve functionally as a boundary between the Welsh and English, effectively oppressing Welsh freedom and discouraging intermingling of the two peoples. It was divisive. The dyke may have been constructed as a result of events with the Princes of the Powys region of Wales, suggesting that parts of the earthwork may have been negotiated boundaries that preserved Welsh claim to certain plots of valuable land. Topographically, the dyke incorporates natural boundaries, such as rivers, and while in some places seems to weave its own path, in other regions strategically aligns with land features such as ridgeways to maximize its impact.   

The place-name Offa's Dyke is a combination of a personal name and a topographical description. In Welsh, it is called _Clawdd Offa_ and the English name derives from the Old English _Offan Dic_. A later English iteration of the place-name is Offendich, maintaining the genitive Old English ending in the 'en'. It has since morphed into its modern English name, although there is now revived debate over whether or not the dyke should be attributed to Offa at all. The modern dyke is paralleled by a footpath that runs for 176 miles from Liverpool Bay to the Severn Estuary. While it is considered a monument, a local landowner destroyed a forty-five-meter section of the dyke in 2013 to build a horse stable and effectively escaped persecution. Offa's Dyke, nevertheless, is remnant from over a 1000 years ago and serves as a testament to the power of the Anglo-Saxons and evidence of the long struggle between the Welsh and English.
