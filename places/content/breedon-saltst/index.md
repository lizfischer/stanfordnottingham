####Breedon On-the-Hill

Breedon On-the-Hill is a village in North West Leicestershire, notable for the Church of St Mary and St Hardulph, which comprises the remains of a 7th century Anglo Saxon Church. It’s an interesting place name because it combines three linguistic forms of ‘hill.’ _Bre_ is a Celtic word for ‘hill,’ _dun_ is an Old English word for ‘hill,’ and _On the Hill_ is self explanatory. 
It’s priory church is know for some of the best surviving Anglo-Saxon stone sculptures, including biblical scenes, saints, animals, and geometric designs. While its overall footprint has shrunk, much of the original Anglo Saxon structure as well as the later Norman structure remains. Originally constructed in 676 CE, the church was sacked by Vikings in the 10th c., and converted from a monastery to a Priory church and rebuilt in 1122. It was expanded in the 13th century, and much of this building - especially the chancel - which is visible today.
Following the dissolution of the monasteries, a local family, the Shirleys, purchased the site from King Henry VIII as a burial place. While unfortunately much of the footprint of the monastery was destroyed, including the entirety of the nave, many of the original carvings were kept. The entire church now fits into what would once have only been the chancel. The North aisle became the repository for the Shirley monuments and tombs, including an imposing alabaster skeleton. 
When we visited it was rainy weather, and peering over the hill we could see the quarry that’s been chipping away at the original site of the church. This has been fatal to much of the evidence that may have been preserved in the landscape, and was a reminder that no matter how natural we think the landscape is, in almost all cases it has been shaped by humans.

#### Salt Street, No Man’s Heath and Appleby Parva

About 14 miles from Breedon On-the-Hill is the small village of Appleby Parva, part of the larger parish of Appleby Magna. Near to here runs Salt Street, an ancient routeway that is still used as a path for walking and tractors. We followed a circuit starting at the Appleby Inn, up a road to the old Salt Street, and through No Man’s Heath. This follows the route of the modern M42 (or, more precisely, the M42 follows the route of the ancient salt street), crossing at a spellow, a particular hill with a view of the route the M42 now follows. After crossing this bridge, we climbed up to No Man’s Heath, and stood at the border of two chartered areas. This was a place where a gallows once stood, and where people may have come together to do business. This was one of our first experiences with a place that is truly in between, and we were all surprised to see the number of houses and settlement that lay in a place without a name.
