West Stow is a village in the Lark River Valley in West Suffolk. In the 1850s, a Saxon cemetery was discovered in the area as a result of gravel-mining. However, the site was not further explored until 1947, when the archaeologist Basil Brown (of Sutton Hoo fame) reported that further gravel-mining was uncovering (and damaging) Anglo-Saxon huts at the site. Stanley West and Vera Evision of the Ministry of Public Building and Works began investigation of the site and determined that much of the settlement still existed. It was later discovered that the entire area had been covered by sand in the 13th century, which had buried and preserved the medieval ridge. In 1974, work began to build a reconstruction of what the village might have looked like, and today the West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village is open to visitors.

##### Name Meaning

“West” most likely refers to its westward position in Suffolk. “Suffolk” comes from OE “suþfolcci,” meaning “south folk.”

_Stōw_ means “place” in Old English. Since this term was rarely used in minor place-names, it denotes a place of special significance; a special venue, usually associated with a saint, a meeting-place, or market. However, the historical significance of this particular site is unknown.

##### 1965-72 Archeological Dig

The main excavation of West Stow was carried out by the West Suffolk Archaeology Unit under Dr. Stanley West. The site is on the north bank of the River Lark, near where it crosses the Icknield Way. In Roman times, the Lark River Valley was densely populated, especially along the south bank. Throughout the site, there is evidence for Mesolithic, Neolithic, and bronze-age activity, which is fairly common for the Breckland; the Anglo-Saxon village itself likely dates from the early 5th century, and was abandoned in the 7th.

The excavation identified three groupings of huts, each associated with a hall-like structure, different in structure and contents, suggesting social grouping. For example, some of the huts were evidently weaving-houses, as shown by the discovery of spindle-whorls, and loom-weights. 

Finds also included many pottery shards, 84 bone combs, and 123 roman coins. Under the system outlined by bone comb scholar Steven Ashby, most of the combs would be classified as 1a, 2b, and 10, with 1a and 10 corresponding neatly to the early 5th century, and type 2b with the 7th.

Incredibly well-preserved food bones were also found, providing insights on the villagers’ diets. Overall, the animal husbandry practices in West Stow were similar to earlier periods and pre-Anglo-Saxon practices, although the village utilized a higher number of pigs when it was first established. Evidently, hunting played a very limited role with few deer and wild mammal bones compared to the number of farm animal bones. These findings suggest that the Anglo-Saxons adapted to the native diet.



##### Reconstruction

The St. Edmundsbury city council planned to turn the area into a rubbish dump following the excavation, but after the discoveries at the site, they chose to found the West Stow Saxon Village Trust and transform the site into an experimental archeological reconstruction. The reconstruction was carried out by undergraduates from Cambridge University, who only used technology and techniques that would have been available in Anglo-Saxon England. The buildings are classified as Sunken-Featured Buildings, or “pit houses,” similar to what the 5th-century village would have had; although it is unknown whether the floor would have been suspended over the pit, leaving space for storage, or on the ground itself. 

The re-enactment village makes West Stow a unique archeological site. Archaeology attempts to reconstruct an image of past human activity through material culture, and the West Stow village is a different method to accomplish this. In fact, by transforming the site into a lived space, the village goes slightly beyond material culture alone. While the lived experience of a 5th-century villager cannot be completely replicated by this context, it is still a useful exercise to imagine.
