    <h3>Lincoln</h3>
    <p>Lincoln is a city in the East Midlands, home to one of the best preserved castles in England, as well as one of the largest cathedrals. It rose to prominence under Norman rule, after William the Conqueror began the construction of both the castle and the Cathedral. The cathedral boasts two grand rose windows and the Wren Library, which holds a collection of 10,000 early print and manuscript works. It previously held one of the four extant versions of the original 1215 Magna Carta, which has since been moved to the Castle for safekeeping.</p>
