    <h3>Montgomery</h3>
    <p>
        Montgomery, Wales—also known by its Welsh name Trefaldwyn—is a small border town between England and Wales
        located in the administrative district of Powys. The earliest attestation of <i>Montgomeri</i> comes from the Domesday
        Book in 1086 and lent itself to the naming of its county, Montgomeryshire. The two sites of historical
        significance we visited in this town were the remains of its castle and its St. Nicholas Parish Church.
