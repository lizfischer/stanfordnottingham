    <h3>West Stow</h3>
    <p>West Stow is a village in West Suffolk. “West” most likely refers to its westward position in Suffolk county;
        “Stow” comes from OE <i>stōw</i>, meaning “special place.” In the 1850s, a Saxon cemetery was discovered in the area.
        However, the site was not further explored until 1947, when Anglo-Saxon huts were uncovered near the site.
        It was later discovered that the entire area had been covered by sand in the 13th century, which had preserved
        the medieval village. A reconstruction of the original village is open to visitors.</p>
