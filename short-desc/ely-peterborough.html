    <h3>Ely and Peterborough</h3>
    <p>The modern cathedral city, Ely, is situated in northeastern England near the River Great Ouse. Its deep
        medieval and Romano-British roots are evidenced by the Roman road, now called Akeman Street, that runs
        through Ely. The meaning of the name “Isle of Ely” has been debated by place-name scholars, but the accepted
        translation of the medieval Latin Elge is “island of eels” or “eel island”, referring to the creatures caught
        in the River Great Ouse.</p>
    <p>Peterborough, along with its cathedral, has a very long and rich history encompassing wars, fires, royalty, and community.  Located near the River Nene, Peterborough’s current cathedral has not only undergone a spiritual transformation from a monastery to a cathedral, but a physical one as well, including three major destructions by warriors and fires, and then multiple restorations by kings, devoted monks, and involved community members.  The cathedral’s complex, yet deep, past is evident in its design and architecture to this very day and continues to leave visitors in awe. </p>
