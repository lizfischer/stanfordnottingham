    <h3>Breedon on the Hill and Salt Street</h3>
    <p>Breedon On-the-Hill is home to the Church of St Mary and St Hardulph, a 8th century Anglo Saxon Church. This church has some of the best surviving Anglo Saxon stone sculptures, including biblical scenes, saints, animals, and geometric designs. While its overall footprint has shrunk, much of the original Anglo Saxon structure as well as the later Norman structure remains. It is about 14 miles from the small village of Appleby Parva, near to which runs the Salt Street, an ancient routeway that is still used as a walking and transportation route.</p>
