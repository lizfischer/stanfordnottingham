    <h3>Icknield Way</h3>
    <p>The Icknield Way is an ancient highway that spans southeastern England from Norfolk to the Dorset Coast. Scholars disagree about the origin of this routewayâ€”some believe it prehistoric, while others date it pre-Roman. The <i>Icenhylte</i> was first mentioned in a 903 C.E. charter, and it was named as an ancient highway in the 1130s. Today, the Icknield Way welcomes travelers as a modern long-distance footpath, with a recommended hike schedule of eight days.</p>
