    <h3>Brixworth</h3>
    <p>This small Northamptonshire village is home to All Saintsâ€™ Church, one of the best preserved examples of Anglo-Saxon architecture.  The church was built in 680 and while it has been dismantled by vikings and altered by Normans, restorations in the 19th century made a faithful return to its Anglo-Saxon roots.  As a result much of the original stonework and design is visible today, providing a glimpse 1300 years into the past.</p>
